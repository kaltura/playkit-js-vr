## Documentation

The Kaltura Player supports 360Â° video in both desktop and mobile device for any kind of motion: mouse, touch, device motion and keyboard keys.

This plugin is depended on [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) library.

The player will be informed that it deals with 360/vr media which is part of the kaltura player config sources (using providers population the sources with the hints below) 

metadata must contain `"tags": "360"` and ` "vr": {}` which is not null

in case app is using setMedia instead of load media `tags and vr` attribues are expected to be populated by app

```
{
  "sources": {
    "options": {},
    "metadata": {
      "tags": "360"
    },
    "hls": [],
    "dash": [],
    "id": "",
    "duration": 362,
    "type": "Vod",
    "poster": "",
    "dvr": false,
    "vr": {},
    "captions": []
  }
}
```


The vr plugin exposes some configurations:

If the Player will load on stereo mode 

If to enable toggle vr/stereo mode button.

![example](./images/vrStereo.png)

If to change the sensitivity of the motion using moveMultiplier attribute.
by default is ```0.15```. 

If to change the sensitivity the device itself, using deviceMotionMultiplier attribute.
by default is ```1```. 

If to change camer options - Theprojection mode is designed to mimic the way the human eye sees. 
It is the most common projection mode used for rendering a 3D scene.
