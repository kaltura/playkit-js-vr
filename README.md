## Documentation

The Kaltura Player supports 360Â° video in both desktop and mobile device for any kind of motion: mouse, touch, device motion and keyboard keys.

This plugin is depended on [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) library.

The player will be informed that it deals with 360/VR media by populating attributes in the `sources` object which is part of the kaltura player config 
it might be populted using providers or the app itself) 

* metadata object must contain `"tags": "360"` and `"vr": {}` object which is not null.

in case app is using setMedia instead of load media `tags and vr` for 360 plyback these attribues are expected to be populated by app

#### Media Sources Example 

```
{
  "sources": {
    "options": {},
    "metadata": {
      "tags": "360"
    },
    "hls": [...],
    "dash": ...],
    "id": "",
    "duration": 362,
    "type": "Vod",
    "poster": "",
    "dvr": false,
    "vr": {},
    "captions": []
  }
}
```


##### The 360/VR plugin exposes some attribures from plugin configurations:

* Player will load on stereo mode 

* Enable toggle vr/stereo mode button.

![example](./images/vrStereo.png)

* Change the sensitivity of the touch motion using moveMultiplier attribute.
by default is ```0.15```. 

* Change the sensitivity the device motion itself, using deviceMotionMultiplier attribute.
by default is ```1```. 

* Change the camera options - The projection mode is designed to mimic the way the human eye sees. 
It is the most common projection mode used for rendering a 3D scene.
[CameraOptions](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/cameras/PerspectiveCamera)

```
plugins: {
...
"vr": { 
      "startInStereo": false,     
      "toggleStereo": false,     
      "moveMultiplier": 0.15,
      "deviceMotionMultiplier": 1,
      "cameraOptions": {
        "fov": 75,
        "aspect": 1.777, // (width/height)
        "near": 0.1,
        "far": 1000
      },
    },
}    
```    

##### VR Plugin Player Event
* `VR_STEREO_MODE_CHANGED` - this event will be fired once user click on the vr icon and changes the playback state from `VR` to `STEREO` mode.

##### VR Plugin Player Error code
* `VR_NOT_SUPPORTED` - this event will be fired once the device used for 360/VR playback does not support this mode.
